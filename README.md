Rust implementation of the [Nomic Bitcoin sidechain](https://github.com/nomic-io/bitcoin-peg).

## Validator setup guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a validator for the Nomic Bitcoin sidechain testnet.

Note: the examples below assume you're using 64-bit Linux.

If you need any help getting your node running, join the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/nomicbtc).

### Requirements

- At least 1GB RAM
- A few hours (to sync your Bitcoin Testnet full node and Nomic full node)
- At least 30GB of available storage (for the Bitcoin Testnet blockchain), or 1GB if you run the Bitcoin node in pruned mode

### 1. Run a Bitcoin testnet full node

Download the Bitcoin core binary with wget, and start a full node in testnet mode:

```bash
wget https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.19.0.1/bitcoin-0.19.0.1-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz && \
tar -xzf bitcoin-0.19.0.1-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz && \
./bitcoin-0.19.0.1/bin/bitcoind -testnet -rpcuser=foo -rpcpassword=bar
```

Syncing your Bitcoin testnet full node will take a few hours, depending on your CPU and bandwidth. Enjoy a cup of tea while you wait.

If you'd like to reduce the amount of storage required, you can instead run the node in pruned mode by adding the `-prune=N` option where N is the amount of storage to use in MB. Example, limiting to 1000MB:
```bash
./bitcoin-0.19.0.1/bin/bitcoind -testnet -prune=1000 -rpcuser=foo -rpcpassword=bar
```

### 2. Run the Nomic ABCI server

Download and run the Nomic ABCI server binary.

```bash
wget https://github.com/nomic-io/rust-bitcoin-peg/releases/download/v0.1.0/nomic-x86_64-linux && \
chmod +x ./nomic-x86_64-linux && \
BTC_RPC_USER=foo BTC_RPC_PASS=bar ./nomic-x86_64-linux
```

The ABCI server will wait for a connection from the local Tendermint node, and you won't see any output. Leave this running while you set up your Tendermint node in the next step.

This server is where the Nomic full node's application logic happens, e.g. validating sidechain transactions and keeping track of account balances. It will talk to a Tendermint consensus process which you will run in the next step.

### 3. Run a Tendermint full node

Install unzip if you don't already have it.

```bash
apt install unzip
```

Download and unzip Tendermint v0.32.8.

```bash
wget https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases/download/v0.32.8/tendermint_v0.32.8_linux_amd64.zip && \
unzip tendermint_v0.32.8_linux_amd64.zip
```

Now configure your Tendermint home directory and start your full node:

```bash
./tendermint init --home ~/.nomic-testnet && \
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomic-io/rust-bitcoin-peg/master/config/genesis.json > ~/.nomic-testnet/config/genesis.json && \
./tendermint node --home ~/.nomic-testnet --p2p.persistent_peers "117930eb8451ae368ba07c18e14cd497ef59f33e@kep.io:26656"
```

You'll see a bunch of output while your node catches up with the rest of the network. This would be a good time for another cup of tea.

This is the consensus process, which is responsible for connecting to the peer-to-peer network, syncing the blockchain, creating new blocks, etc.

### 4. Run the relayer

The relayer scans Bitcoin for new block headers and broadcasts them to the sidechain. It's what bridges the Bitcoin network and the Nomic sidechain network.

Download and run the latest version of the relayer:

```bash
wget https://github.com/nomic-io/rust-bitcoin-peg/releases/download/v0.1.0/relayer-x86_64-linux && \
chmod +x relayer-x86_64-linux && \
BTC_RPC_USER=foo BTC_RPC_PASS=bar ./relayer-x86_64-linux
```

You'll see the latest Bitcoin block hash printed whenever a new block is mined.

### 5. Run the work generator

At this point, you are now running a *full node*, but since your node does not have any voting power it is not yet a *validator*.

To gain voting power on the Nomic sidechain, full nodes must create [hashcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash) proofs-of-work. This process lets participation in the network remain open and permissionless.

Download and run the single-CPU work generation script:

```bash
wget https://github.com/nomic-io/rust-bitcoin-peg/releases/download/v0.1.0/worker-x86_64-linux && \
chmod +x worker-x86_64-linux && \
./worker-x86_64-linux
```

You won't see any output, but you can watch your voting power increase at [http://localhost:26657/status](http://localhost:26657/status). You're now a validator on the Nomic sidechain! Keep your node running to help ensure stability of the network.

### Backing up your private key

Your validator is signing blocks with a unqiue private key stored at `~/.nomic-testnet/config/priv_validator_key.json`. Remember to keep this safe since losing it would mean you lose the voting power you worked hard to get. Also, keep it safe since if an attacker got a hold of it they would be able to attack the network, also resulting in the loss of your voting power.

However, as the network is still just an early testnet and security is not as critical yet, it probably is sufficient to just copy the file to another folder:

```bash
cp ~/.nomic-testnet/config/priv_validator_key.json ~/nomic-key-backup.json
```

### Hard-resetting your node

Since Nomic is in the early stages, we may end up resetting the network after making a backwards-incompatible change, or introduce a bug which results in corrupt data. If we specify that you need to hard reset your node, simply make sure you've backed up the key as in the above section, then remove all the data:

```bash
rm -rf merk.db && \ # located in the directory where you ran the ABCI server 
rm -rf ~/.nomic-testnet
```

Then follow the setup steps again as normal (skipping step 1, the Bitcoin node setup), but copy your validator private key back in after running `tendermint init` in step 3:
```bash
cp nomic-key-backup.json ~/.nomic-testnet/config/priv_validator_key.json
```

### Next Steps

In the future, validator nodes like yours will also be responsible for helping manage the network's Bitcoin reserves. Stay tuned as the Nomic sidechain develops, and join the discussion in the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/nomicbtc)!
